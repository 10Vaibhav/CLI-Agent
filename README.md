# CLI AI Voice Agent 

An intelligent voice-powered command-line AI assistant that helps you interact with your system through natural speech. Build complete projects from scratch, manage files, and execute system commands—all through voice commands and conversational prompting.

## Overview

CLI AI Voice Agent is a voice-enabled conversational AI assistant powered by chain-of-thought reasoning. It listens to your voice commands, understands your requests, and executes them intelligently—whether you're creating a single file or developing an entire application from the ground up. Just speak what you want to build, and the agent handles the implementation with voice feedback—similar to vibe coding in modern AI IDEs, but hands-free in your terminal.

### Voice Features

- **Speech-to-Text**: Speak naturally using your microphone—powered by Google Speech Recognition
- **Text-to-Speech**: Get cheerful voice responses using OpenAI's TTS (gpt-4o-mini-tts with coral voice)
- **Hands-Free Operation**: Complete voice-driven workflow from input to output
- **Ambient Noise Adjustment**: Automatically adapts to your environment

## Key Features

### Full Project Development from Scratch
- **Vibe Coding in Terminal**: Describe your project idea and watch it come to life
- **End-to-End Implementation**: From project structure to complete codebase
- **Multi-File Generation**: Creates entire applications with proper architecture
- **Framework Agnostic**: React, Next.js, Flask, Django, Express—you name it

### Intelligent Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
- Breaks down complex tasks into logical steps
- Shows transparent reasoning before executing
- Maintains conversation context for iterative development

### Comprehensive Tool System
- **File Operations**: Create, read, update, delete files and directories
- **System Commands**: Execute any terminal command with full access
- **Development Workflow**: Package managers, build tools, testing, deployment

### Voice-Powered Natural Language Interface
- **Voice Input**: Speak naturally—no typing required
- **Voice Output**: Hear responses in a cheerful, delightful voice
- **Conversational Interaction**: Just describe what you want
- **No Command Syntax**: No commands to memorize
- **Context-Aware**: Maintains conversation history across interactions

### Use Cases

- **Full Stack Development**: Build complete applications from a single prompt
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Quickly scaffold and iterate on ideas
- **Project Setup**: Initialize any framework or tech stack
- **File Management**: Organize and manipulate files effortlessly
- **System Automation**: Execute complex command sequences naturally

### How It Works

1. **Speak**: Say what you want to build using your microphone
2. **Listen**: Agent processes your speech using Google Speech Recognition
3. **Plan**: AI breaks down the task with chain-of-thought reasoning
4. **Execute**: Automatically creates files, runs commands, builds structure
5. **Respond**: Hear the results in a cheerful voice via OpenAI TTS
6. **Iterate**: Continue the voice conversation to refine and expand

### Technical Architecture

- **Speech Recognition**: Google Speech Recognition API for voice input
- **AI Model**: OpenAI GPT with structured output parsing
- **Text-to-Speech**: OpenAI gpt-4o-mini-tts with coral voice
- **Chain-of-Thought**: Multi-step reasoning with START → PLAN → TOOL → OUTPUT flow
- **Tool System**: Modular file and system operation tools
- **Async Audio**: Non-blocking audio playback for smooth interaction
